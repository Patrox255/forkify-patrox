# forkify Project

Recipe application with custom recipe uploads, which was created by me during Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course on Udemy. The features that I implemented just by myself include:
- changed appearance of form inside recipe adding window, as well as added error handling,
- shopping list, where user can determine which ingredients he needs in order to prepare all meals,
- recipe calendar, where user can assign recipes for individual dates
